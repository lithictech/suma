# Suma

Suma is a platform and application for collective purchasing and local community empowerment.
It is focuses on the needs of low-income people, people of color,
and other frontline communities, who have traditionally be unserved by technology.

It is steered by [https://mysuma.org](https://mysuma.org),
a digital justice nonprofit.

## Infrastructure

Right now, Suma is designed to be hosted on Heroku,
though it will be pretty simple to run it via Docker or other hosting platforms in the future.

Suma's backend is a Ruby server, and its frontends are Single Page Applications in React.
As explained in our [Guiding Technical Principals](https://github.com/lithictech/suma/blob/main/docs/index.md#guiding-principles),
we aim to minimize dependencies, so the Rack server actually serves the frontend.

This involves two non-obvious features in the codebase:

- Instead of building just a Ruby app, we also need the JavaScript toolchain available
  for building the React production build. So to build a production build,
  always use `make build-frontends`, which builds the React app into `./build-webapp`.
  The Rack app then serves that directory as static content at `/app`, as below.
- We have some custom Rack middleware for servering the React SPAs
  and other static assets ([see here](https://github.com/lithictech/suma/tree/main/lib/rack)).
  This allows us to have a "zero configuration" deployment.
  For a faster option, you can set up your reverse proxy (nginx or whatever)
  to serve the static assets instead.
