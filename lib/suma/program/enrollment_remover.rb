# Logic that runs when a member sees reduction in program access;
# for example, losing a role, getting an expired organization membership,
# having a direct enrollment removed, etc.
#
# Each removal calculation can be somewhat slow, so the removal is done asynchronously-
# users will lose the ability to see a program immediately, but secondary effects
# like closing a vendor account will happen afterwards.
#
# We haven't figured out a generic way to process un-enrollments,
# since there is a lot of nuance with how resources can be shared.
#
# For example, we don't want to remove someone from a Lyft Pass program
# if they have access to any program using it; we don't want to close
# someone's Lime account if any program gives them access to a Lime vendor service.
#
# So this logic is closely coupled to knowing about what external resources
# may need revocation.

  # Revoking lyft pass is complex for a couple reasons:
  #
  # First, we can't just revoke access to any unenrolled programs;
  # we need to make sure the member cannot still access that lyft pass program from a different suma program.
  # We only revoke access to lyft passes the member can no longer access at all.
  #
  # Second, and more confusingly, we need to update the VendorAccount tied to the LyftPass vendor configuration,
  # to un-mark the member as registered in that lyft pass program. This way, if the member gains new access
  # to this lyft pass program id, the correct code paths (prompting them to 'link' their account,
  # and thus regain access to Lyft Pass) will run.
