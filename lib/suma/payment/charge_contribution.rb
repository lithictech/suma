  # Runs a simulation to find the ideal cash contribution to take advantage of all payment triggers.
  #
  # See docs/payment-automation.md for additional details.
  #
  # This code runs +Suma::Payment::Account#calculate_charge_contributions+
  # with a number of different contexts, to find the minimum cash charge
  # (funding transaction) that would result in enough triggered payments/subsidies
  # to cover the given amount.
  #
  # The order this takes is:
  #
  # - Use $0 cash. It's possible we can cover the full amount using existing ledger subsidy.
  # - Use $amount cash. If we have any cash balance left on our ledger,
  #   we start bisecting.
  # - Run an iterative bisect. Start with $candidate=$amount/2.
  #   Add cash of $candidate amount and:
  #   - If we have a balance on our cash ledger, it's possible we can contribute less.
  #     Set $candidate=$candidate/2**stepnum (bisect between the current candidate and $0).
  #   - If we have no remainder and no balance on our cash ledger,
  #     we've hit the correct amount exactly.
  #   - If we have a remainder (which implies we have no cash ledger balance),
  #     we need to contribute more cash. Set $candidate=$candidate+$candidate/2**stepnum
  #     (bisect between the current and previous candidate).
  # - Keep going until we hit the correct amount (as above).
  # - If we don't hit the correct amount, raise an error.
  #   In theory it would be ok to find a 'minimum' charge that leaves a remainder,
  #   but given the limitations above (that we need to maintain $0 on the cash ledger),
  #   we need to error if we don't find an exact match.
  #   Note: This case may be impossible. We do not have a unit test for it.
  # - If the correct amount is less than the minimum funding amount, raise an error.
