## DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES OUTSIDE OF `webapp`

These files are shared between our JS/React apps,
with the original source in `webapp/src/shared`.

Use `make sync-shared` in the other app folders to pull in these files.
In the future we can muse more sophisticated sharing mechanisms,
but duplicating is fine for now.
