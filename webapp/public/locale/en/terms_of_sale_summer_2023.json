Buyers also must ensure acceptance of all applicable terms and conditions from Seller or Third Parties. Because participation in the 2023 Suma Summer Hack program is limited, Seller will, in its sole discretion, determine if you may place an order after this initial set up. Orders may not be cancelled or rescheduled without Seller's written consent. If, after the initial set up, you are authorized by Seller to place an order, all orders must identify the products, unit quantities, applicable prices and requested transportation information, for the Goods being used or purchased. Unless otherwise agreed, Buyer is responsible for obtaining all Goods. Seller may, in its sole discretion, allocate Goods among Buyers.\n\n**2) Prices:** For the 2023 Suma Summer Hack program, only, potential Buyers initially shall deposit five USD ($5.00), which will allow authorized and qualified Buyers to receive an initial credit of nineteen USD ($19.00) from Seller. That money and those credits are eligible for use by qualified Buyers at a participating Farmers' Market. Following that, once a week, qualified and authorized Buyers will be entitled to add up to an additional fifteen USD ($15.00), which Seller will match with additional credits at a ratio of 1:1. Seller may, in its sole discretion, adjust the availability and offerings of any credits. If Buyer is neither qualified nor authorized to place an order, Seller will return the initial five USD ($5.00) deposit.\n\n**3) Payment:** Payment may be made on Seller's Website by credit card, through Stripe, Seller's third-party payment processor.\n\n**4) Delivery and Title:** For the 2023 Suma Summer Hack program, only, Buyer may select to “pick up” their Goods at the participating Farmers' Market.

All pick-ups will be made to the location provided to Buyer at time of purchase. Title and risk of loss pass to the Buyer upon pickup by the Buyer of the Goods from the selected community location. Seller's delivery dates and times are estimates only and Seller is not liable for delays in delivery or for failure to perform due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the Seller. Buyers must ensure acceptance of all applicable terms and conditions from Seller or Third Parties.\n\n**5) Returns, Refunds, and Exchanges:** All purchases from the 2023 Suma Summer Hack program are final and non-returnable nor exchangeable.
